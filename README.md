Follow these steps to set up and run the **Password Generator** on your computer:

1. Download the repository as a zip file and unzip it.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the password generator directory by typing `cd path/to/your/directory/password-generator-main`.
3. In the command prompt now type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the required packages.
4. Now you should type `pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --add-data "assets/icon.png;assets" --add-data "assets/icon.ico;assets" --hidden-import "ttkbootstrap" --icon "assets/icon.ico" --distpath . "Password Generator.py" & rmdir /s /q build & del "Password Generator.spec"` to install the Password Generator as a standalone executable.
4. Now the Password Generator.exe file should be in password-generator-main and you can run it.


## File Structure
- Password Generator.py: Entry point to run the application.
- gui.py: Defines the graphical user interface.
- gui_functions.py: Contains core logic for password generation and functionality.
- assets/: Directory for resources like the application icon.

## Troubleshooting
- **Add PyInstaller to PATH**: If you encounter the error `'pyinstaller' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file`, you need to add the PyInstaller directory to your system's PATH.
- **Missing Dependencies**: If the application fails due to missing dependencies, ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed. Run `pip list` in the command prompt.
- **Windows antivirus**: If Windows antivirus blocks pyinstaller from turning the code into a standalone excecutable: Click the popup "Allow on device", then "Start action".
